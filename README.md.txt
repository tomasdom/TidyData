The script proceeds by loading the training data, the testing data, and the features file. The training data and testing data collumn names are changed to the names in variable 2 of the features file, which are more descriptive of the actual variables. The training and testing data are then merged using rbind(). Then, apply() is used to create data frames for the mean and standard deviation of each variable. These data frames are merged using rbind(), and the resulting data frame is printed using print.table()
